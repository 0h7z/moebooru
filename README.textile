h1. Moebooru

This project is based on original Moebooru which is being used in "yande.re Image Board":http://yande.re. Changes compared to original Moebooru:

* Requires Ruby 1.9
* Uses Rails 3.0 (woohoo)
* Uses Bundler
* Updated gems
* Pool ZIP support for nginx (with @mod_zip@)

As this is still in development, bug reports are welcome.

* "Demo site":http://moe.myconan.net
* "Source Repository":http://bitbucket.org/edogawaconan/moebooru

h2. Requirements

As this is ongoing project, there will be more changes on requirement as this project goes. Currently this application requires:

* Ruby 1.9 (1.8 should also works, too)
* PostgreSQL (tested with 8.4)
* Bundler gem
* GD image library header
* And various other requirement for the gems (check @Gemfile@ for the list)

On RHEL5, it goes like this:

* gcc
* gcc-c++
* gd-devel
* jhead
* libxslt-devel
* libyaml-devel
* mercurial
* openssl-devel
* pcre-devel
* postgresql84-contrib
* postgresql84-devel
* postgresql84-server
* readline-devel

On Ubuntu 10.04.4 LTS

* @apt-get install postgresql-contrib python-software-properties postgresql libpq-dev libxml2-dev libxslt-dev mercurial jhead build-essential libgd2-noxpm-dev@

* "Brightbox repo":http://blog.brightbox.co.uk/posts/next-generation-ruby-packages-for-ubuntu would work if you're too lazy to compile ruby

* add the ppa and then @apt-get install ruby1.9.3@
